<h>Photocapturasis Syndrome</h>
<p>Photocapturasis Syndrome is a serious disorder spreading its wings and conquering the minds. The patients are concerned boundlessly with clicking photographs and even forget to enjoy that particular moment. The sole aim becomes to capture the moment and further upload it on social-networking sites for the world to see and feel jealous.</p>
<p>But in such cases, enjoyment is brutally murdered and confined to an invisible cage. Once while visiting a museum, I felt a powerful urge to keep on clicking photographs and later that evening the realization came that I missed the sole pleasure of observation and focus on delicate beauties, for the mind was bent on extinguishing endless cravings of photography.</p>
<p>The cure of this ailment lies in reducing the magnetic effects of photography by using the God-gifted eyes. For a photograph once clicked and seen a few times loses its worth and is thrown mercilessly in the storehouse of memories. But the sights, most of them, are preserved in the deep ocean like pearls in oyster shells.</p>
<p>And, how wonderful are human eyes that no camera can compete or capture as efficiently.</p>
<p>We see the sea, the ebb and flow,</p>
<p>But a camera copies, not with as natural a glow.</p>
