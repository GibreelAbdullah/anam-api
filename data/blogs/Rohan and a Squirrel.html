<h>Rohan and a Squirrel</h>
<p>Friendship is something that erases boundaries and creates a special bonding. Rohan was a young boy who was quick in making friends. Everyone liked him. The neighbors always chatted about his gentle manners that were scarce in their own children.</p>
<p>One bright day, he saw a squirrel near his window and smiled. He was quite fond of squirrels. In fact his classmates called him squirrel due to his quick movements, combination of mischief and intelligence, and due to his natural love for peanuts. The next day again he saw it running subtly after having sensed some disturbance. This time he peeped out to find that the squirrel's nest was on the outer side of the window. He got a good exercise to do. After all his Mathematics exercises weren't as interesting.</p>
<p>He was about to say 'mom, what do squirrels eat?' when he himself recalled the answer 'ah, yes, peanuts and nuts, etc.' Next day onwards, he began placing the nuts on the window and curiously watching it hold the food and eat charmingly. He tried to imitate it after making sure that nobody was around.</p>
<p>Soon they were friends. He felt a cry of joy when first touching it, holding its hands. It ran away in no time. He kept experimenting with various food items in the house and once observed it sucking the straw attached to a mini fruit juice paper box.</p>
<p>One night a scary storm came and its house was shattered in minute pieces. It entered Rohan's room in search of protection and settled in his cap placed upside down creating a comfortable abode. In the morning he woke up feeling touched at the sight of it resting in his cap and was later devastated to find the nest broken.</p>
<p>He then put the twigs, dry grasses, mud, etc. in one corner and watched it, fresh as dew, preparing the nest once again. It taught him that life is the other name of fresh possibilities and hope. He learnt from the little one's zeal and opened his Mathematics textbook with a newly acquired enthusiasm to complete his work.</p>
