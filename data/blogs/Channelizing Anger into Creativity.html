<h>Channelizing Anger into Creativity</h>
<p>We all belong to the amazing human race and are prone to anger just as much as hunger, love, emotions, etc. The only thing that makes a difference is how we take it: whether we make it or break it. Just imagine a man discovering a great hidden secret in a fit of rage. How interesting it would be. Unfortunately, many of us end up breaking things in anger (Bollywood style) or splattering away harsh, unintended words that are hurtful to those whom we love.</p>
<p>Once, in my carefree school days, I was punished harshly for not bringing a particular text book to school. The reason was that I was completely absorbed in reading it seriously and just forgot to pack it in my bag. After that unpleasant experience I was burning with rage and wanted to get out of my misery. I tore the pages of my notebook when the exams ended. The result was a paper house that looked cute. The crushed paper attained greater beauty than ever before.</p>
<p>The quest for beauty is an incredible task, for beauty lies in almost everything, but is veiled. Life is a unique race where disappointments chase us and anger is its by-product. You wait for people. They seem less caring. At times, waiting becomes suffocating. At that very instant if someone reads you four lines of heart-rending poetry, wouldn't that be amazing? If you are promised something and at the very next moment your expectations are thwarted, bitterness alone remains in your heart. At that moment, if a drawing is scribbled, mirroring your state of mind, won’t it be exciting?</p>
<p>The worst experiences of human life include losing one’s loved ones. The burning and exploding lava of anger and devastation is extremely hard to overcome. The truth in fact is that nothing is impossible. The theory of ‘Never say I can’t. Strive and achieve what you want’ can be helpful. The act worth respecting in such a situation would be to create something long lasting, that will become an emblem of our emotions and will be equally relevant in other’s lives as well. A metaphorical Taj Mahal can be constructed anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>So tomorrow if your bus comes late, or something happens, use the tool of creativity to comfort yourself. Capture images, draw lines, write songs, crush the paper and create. Don’t forget to take a deep breath or drink cool water. Well, this applies to us equally. Let’s beat this anger together since we’re here in these conflicting times and need to do something constructive.</p>
