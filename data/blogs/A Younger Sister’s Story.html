<h>A Younger Sister’s Story</h>
<p>Sara was gazing at the toffee boxes in a shop like a butterfly gazing at a flower. Scratching her head she wondered which one to choose. A two rupee note was a pretty good amount for a little child like her to be satisfied. She consulted her brother, a year older than her and yet of same taste. He presented his views like an elder brother. ‘That’s coffee bite, fifty paise each, and tastes good’. She replied: ‘But… I think mango bite is a better one’. The shopkeeper was smiling and said softly ‘what a decision you’re making! Be quick. Bigger ones await you in future’. She bought mango bite and popped it in her mouth.</p>
<p>Both Sara and Ahad went to school together, played together, and fought after regular intervals. As Diwali was approaching, Ahad was thrilled to buy firecrackers. Both went to a small set-up and began selecting the ones they liked. The rockets with a red cap were gorgeous. The next day while lighting the string attached to the rocket, its direction was suddenly changed and it found innocent Sara’s hand to hit and later collapsed at the wall nearby. She was in shock and wept for hours even though the hurt was minor.</p>
<p>Their father had a rice mill and during winters their pastime was to play hide and seek on the mountain of infinite rice bags, 100 Kg each, covered with a tremendous waterproof blanket. Once they played longer than usual and were so lost in game that they didn’t notice the guard closing the main gate. At a scary instant they realized their plight and began to cry. Hearing muffled cries and shouts, a passer-by informed their father and they were rescued.</p>
<p>As they reached higher classes, various tutors were assigned for them. But due to their unbridled playfulness, each teacher lost the seriousness after a span of time and fun leaped in, diverting the sole aim of education. Once a very scary tutor came and punished Ahad for his lack of concentration. Sana, the younger sister did nothing but passed a smile that infuriated him and he hit her cheeks later. She was quick in complaining and Ahad was punished again.</p>
<p>Each passing day the gaps between them seemed to widen. Sana became a hard-working student while her brother was a sports lover rather than a study-lover. After topping in class tenth she went to the excellent school far away and stayed in a hostel. One day, surprisingly Ahad came to meet her with a home-made cake. She was glad with twinkling eyes. He gave her a piece of paper, smiled and left. Just two lines were written there:</p>
<p>Kiss thine dreams, do smile each day,</p>
<p>My adorable sister, Happy Birthday!</p>
