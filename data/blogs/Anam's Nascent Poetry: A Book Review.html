<h>Anam's Nascent Poetry: A Book Review</h>
<p>Poems are succinctly written vividly capturing the everyday life of common populace. One can easily relate to them. They give a sheen of calmness and an agreeable feeling with your words.</p>
<p>Some of them beautifully capture the beauty of things and ways of world that are cruel. Your words seem to paint a picture of circumstances both good and bad.</p>
<p>Your poems give way to the scenes of life. One seems to relive them through the beauty of your poetry and the description that rekindle epithets of memory in mind.</p>
