<h>Under the Radiant Sky</h>
<p>The sky was luminescent and the water radiant. The trees lined the lake and seemed to reach the skies. The sight was a pure balm to my soul. May be I was on a boat. The movement was silky and wavy. Somebody sat there with me. His eyes fell on me like the perfect warmth one feels while sitting beside the fire on a chilly morning. The moment was so perfect that I couldn't suppress my urge to capture it on my phone. The branches of trees touched their neighbors and netted the sky in a majestic fashion. The leaves were clustered together like stars, with a royal green glow. 'One two three. Perfect. One more. Ah wonderful'. As I was capturing the sky with awe, he was keenly gazing at my expressions with a rare delicacy. We conversed something I don't remember. May be our words were silent. May be our hearts were communing directly. The crystal clear water and cool air filled with positivity gave a glimpse of Heaven. The only anxiety was that 'it will all pass'. The bubble will break. How could I live that moment to the utmost. Heart's palpitations were too loud. I thought he heard them. His presence was enough to add sense to everything around us. My heart was about to burst with a profound joy.</p>
<p>The boat then disappeared and we were just walking side by side. A blurry vision made it hard to see clearly. We then reached the shore. People were placing their feet in the water and making merry. I felt a sudden urge to do the same. I heard him asking me for dinner and I said that I will take permission and let him know. That clear voice was a delight I longed for since long. May be then he left or he stood there at a distance looking at me. I don't remember.</p>
<p>Then I removed my school shoes and socks. That made me doubt if I was in my school dress, skirt and shirt. As I plunged my feet in the water, it seemed as if the water suddenly turned shallow and I couldn't sink my feet inside. Then strange flowers or corals or starfish appeared floating in the water. Not very sure about what it exactly was. The crowd thickened. I went past the people and everything seemed to be covered in a blackish mist. Just his voice remained, echoing deep in my heart, like a melody that gets stuck in mind and stubbornly refuses to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Then I realized that Dreams come true in Dreams too.</p>
