<h>Book Review: The Struggle Between My Heart & My Brain by Mehr Bani</h>
<p>'Rationality  doesn't work with the organ named heart, but faith does and the blinder your faith is, the stronger the conviction you can draw out of it.'</p>
<p>A woman's mind is a fascinating arena where the opinion of heart and brain scarcely coincides and there's an everlasting tug-of-war going on. Mehr Bani's novel effectively portrays the tragic-comic conflict and emotional embellishment that a hu'wo'man has been blessed with.</p>
<p>The story moves on smoothly, unveiling the diverse phases of love, from a nascent beginning to the phase of deep understanding, narrowing down to the cloud of complaints, expectations and returning to the rational understanding. The author subtly implies that not all love stories reach the flyover of marriage.</p>
<p>The theme of marriage has been well put-up. The novel begins with the pre-wedding fervor and henna ceremony of the main protagonist, Preet and ends at the commencement of her marriage. The access of the reader to her mind's complicated threads weave appealing and intricate patterns in the story. The reader stays curious from the beginning till the end about the person Preet will be marrying.</p>
<p>The writing style reflects simplicity with a philosophical outlook. The soft romance, chit-chatting, friendship, flirtation, bonding, understanding, and misunderstanding are some of the major elements in the novel. This is the story of today's generation, a story of you and me, a realistic account where the borders of religion, caste, culture, age, etc. emerge like walls between the two lovers. It's heartbreaking too at some extent. The colliding fragments of emotions of love, have to settle at the end at a particular surface, willingly or unwillingly. There's an emphasis on the idea of 'happy ending', being a rare reality.</p>
<p>The novel ends with a question 'Everything is made of matter but nothing really matters-does it?'. The topmost question that popped up in my mind at the end was: 'Is love irrational, unattainable, a strong emotion that has to turn weak with the passage of time?' </p>
<p>This book is a must read for the people caught between the soft threads of love, shifting between ecstasy, epiphany and melancholy, driving the 'roller-coaster' of emotions, alone or accompanied. May be, love is just about memories and magic, maybe it's the 'matter' that the universe is comprised of, or may be it doesn't 'matter' as much. Read the book to find your own answer!</p>
