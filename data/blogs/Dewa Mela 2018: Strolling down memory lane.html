<h>Dewa Mela 2018: Strolling down memory lane</h>
<p>It was a sheer delight to be present at home this Dewa Mela 2018 and enjoy the intricacies of the entire fair vividly. It was an occasion to observe the hustle-bustle and go beyond the crowd to find the individuals as they are, united in the need for pleasure, entertainment and moments of mirth. </p>
<p>The most terrific and exciting moment was at Ranger, a 360-degree rotation swing that let the world turn upside down. Just a day before, life looked dull and gloomy, mind was as usual heavy. Random walks to dewa mela were fine but work pressure kept a check on every feeling. So as I went near the ticket counter it was written 50 Rs. The prices were dropped by 20 since the day it arrived. All done I sat in the jhula, excited beyond words. Seat guard was put down, locks were done, a big iron protective case covered the jhula sideways. And then it started moving. One, two, three, the speed multiplied shaking the heart too. The seat guard was moving a little. My heart pounded. What if I just fall. The best thrilling experience is when it’s accompanied with fear. The jhula swung higher, almost touching the sky, rocking every daring soul on it. I could hear and see people’s coins and cards in the upper pocket falling downwards. I was laughing. It was a pleasant sound of laughter and thrill. Seemed like I never heard it before. I said ‘Subhan Allah’ more than once I guess, immersed in that new experience. Whoa what a feeling. Suspended in the air, upside down for a few seconds. Then again, another round. After a few rounds it slowed down and stopped. As I flipped out of it, my eyes flashed with excitement and I was still lost in that momentary ecstasy, unable to walk straight for a few seconds. That happy sensation lasted for a few days. I felt so good as if the worries of life fell too from my mind at that upside-down moment.</p>
<p>I wished to experience it again. The fear element evaporated since I already knew how the jhula rotated. So I sat on it again. It started moving. I was so confident and happy. I could look at the lights all around. It was a sight of bliss and glories. I loved every moment. It passed so speedily. I could find some similarities with Ranger and life in general. Moving slowly then speeding up then making one fall yet held and protected by a divine command. Then another turn and another. Interestingly this time it didn’t felt that awesome. Just like a kind of life whose incidents were known beforehand, no excitement, nothing. Thank God! Life isn’t this way. We don’t know what the next moment holds and this makes it even more interesting. Just a warm feeling of being cared for and loved by Allah is enough for us to be able to face every kind of trial, every roller coaster ride.</p>
