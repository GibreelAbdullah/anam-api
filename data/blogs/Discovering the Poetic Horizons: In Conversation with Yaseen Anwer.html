<question>Q. Is it really necessary to fall in love to write love poetry?</question>
<answer>A. You need muse, don't you? Just falling in love, not sure, but yes admiring someone does, spending time with someone also does. It may not always be a girl, it can be a place you have fallen in love with. There are people who are inspired by mountains. Its more about being in the state of mind where you end up writing because of someone or something.</answer>
<question>Q. Even little things excite poets, isn't it?</question>
<answer>A. Depends. To some its beauty that excites, to some its pain.</answer>
<question>Q. What do you think about a poet's 'burden' or 'responsibilities' with respect to society as a change-maker?</question>
<answer>A. Seeing a poet simply as a change-maker and the power of poetry as an agent of change can be mythical. A poet should have a view on things happening around and if has, it will certainly reflect in his writing. A considerable amount of effort has to be made and one has to consistently work on it to observe the impact.</answer>
<question>Q. With the current trend of Slam Poetry and an air of self-centered and distant writing, has the idea of poetry attained an enclosed, idealistic identity away from reality?</question>
<answer>A. There are a segment of writers who grow distant from society and find an alternate world under the shade of nature, hilltops, etc. Slam poetry in itself is just a dot in the universe of poetry, there is lot more in poetry, why should we talk of just slam poetry!</answer>
<question>Q. What do you think about the lost art of writing letters in this fast paced world?</question>
<answer>A. It will be almost impossible to revive it. Things that have a relation with commerce can only stay alive. Languages die with time, what are letters!</answer>
<question>Q. English, Urdu or Hindi, which is the most friendly and expressive language?</question>
<answer>A. For a poet, the language in which he thinks is the best language to write in, precisely, one's mother-tongue. The natural beauty and personal instincts can be best expressed through it.</answer>
<question>Q. How significant is writing for you?</question>
<answer>A. For me, writing comes when nothing else is possible, when someone or something strikes me deep within to an extent that it will tear me apart. It forces me into some state that can make me go mad till it comes out. Writing can never go out of me. When I am not writing I am still writing something and erasing, those not erased come out for others to see.</answer>
<question>Q. What are traits of excellent poetry?</question>
<answer>A. Words compressed, speaking more in less words and depth, universality and timelessness that  surpasses all boundaries and reaches out to a wider audience.</answer>
<question>Q. Is reading the most necessary thing to become a better poet?</question>
<answer>A. Reading is certainly the most important thing not just for a poet but for a writer but yes again It shouldn't be limited to just reading, writing and then re-writing helps you to get better. Writing is almost meditating.</answer>
<question>Q. 'You write too!', 'Poets are there in every lane' how should a poet face the negative vibes and stand apart in the budding community of fellow poets?</question>
<answer>A. Here again I talk about Universality and timelessness. If it is there in your work, it will surpass all boundaries and reach out to a wider audience. Also, it takes time to prefect the art of writing. One has to cover a long way and stay focused to reach the stage of acclamation and appreciation.</answer>
<question>Q. You favorite genre of poems?</question>
<answer>A. Favorite is not an apt word since it's restrictive and creates boundaries. Poems showcasing reality, depth, unmasking the truth, and rich in relativity interest me.</answer>
<question>Q. Which poets would you recommend to read (in Urdu)?</question>
<answer>A. Daag Dehlvi and Basheer Badr are the must read poets to explore the vivacity of Urdu.  </answer>
<question>Q. How distant is a poetic world and un-poetic reality?</question>
<answer>A. For an honest poet, there isn't any dissimilarity between the virtual and the real. There's always a sense of restlessness. What's written is a reflection of prevailing realities. In fact, the presence of good poets is a sign of bad society.</answer>
<question>Q. How important is vocabulary in poetry?</question>
<answer>A. Vocabulary is not the most essential aspect of a good piece. It's more about the words that fit in and create an impact. A play on words and effective communication creates a long-lasting and heart-touching impression. It's also about how differently one expresses a particular emotion.     </answer>
<question>Q. Comment on a poet's keen eye and observation power? Does a poet sees differently?</question>
<answer>A. Good poets are great observers. Yes they see things differently and notice more. For instance, while looking at a motorbike, a number of stories can be spun around: a hard-working man dropping his kids to school on his way to work, etc. This is beyond an ordinary person's interest.     </answer>
<question>Q. Short poems are more in fashion than long ones in the world of Social Media. Your response?</question>
<answer>A. Short poems work as magnets to attract target audience's attention. Once that interest is secured, people can go on reading the long poems as well.      </answer>
<question>Q. Does happiness create a similar effect on writing or the creation of best works is all about the pain that inspired it?</question>
<answer>A. Well for me its restlessness that works more, and restlessness is mostly the result of pain. But at the same time I feel it's more about the feeling and thought that inspires the work.  </answer>
<p>At the end, one of his beautiful couplet:</p>

<q>Ander tumharey dafn humara Jo hissa he

<q>Sacredly buried in the depths of you, my part,
Lived, when the rest of me was so falling apart!</q>
