<h>Just Another Day</h>
<p>Today isn't yesterday or tomorrow but a day as free as a spider's web, with wondrous mysteries and creativity to work on. I've been given not just life but the responsibility to give something 'to day' by living it with gratitude. All great thoughts peeped at asleep me. Winter morns can be best celebrated in a warm and cozy blanket, wrapped in dreams.</p>
<p>After a considerably long time, the sleep spell silently vanished. The hunger bells were rung gradually at some depths. Yet newspaper magnetism was automatically activated. Silence! Such an expression carries the heavy pain that's felt after coming face to face with harsh realities. Somebody's killed or raped or burnt by acid or punished for trivialities or made a victim of inequalities. We're safe but God knows for how long. Some politician gave a bouquet of flattering and deceiving promises, highly imaginative pieces of impossibilities. Sadly fiction and truth got intertwined in our world. Pushing away the recorder of happenings, I went to brush my teeth. There are two basins at home and the toothpaste and toothbrush took divorce. I had put a bulky dot of paste on the brush and moved to the other side. Whoa! where's the paste dot gone. I was searching like a CID and found it midway. What a relief! No matter what's lost, the pleasure of regaining it is usually the same.</p>
<p>Later a neighborhood child came packed with curiosities and inspected everything perceived. Good to gaze at a specimen of innocence, of untainted childhood, somewhere to turn to and smile. I was quick in hiding away my cellphone and tablet since the upcoming generation seems too intelligent to bear. Games and photography are the most sought for. One day, after finding my phone she took a selfie and even today shares the same passion towards technology. May be we shall see a day when remote controls would be available for monitoring kids. I hope that green garden's place shan't be taken by the four sided devices providing exciting games, mimicking the natural ones.</p>
<p>Then I turned to my window facing the road and mirroring an exciting world. The children of my lane are incredible. There's a small school nearby. Once a dog entered playfully and chased the little ones who crossed the way without harming them. It was indeed funny to see them running. Another day a little crying girl was carried by two siblings to the school. Her expressions were genuinely painful and made me wonder at the plight of that child who was being carried to so called knowledge kingdom.</p>
<p>Night arrived slowly after the sun melted into the horizon.</p>
<p>How speedily a day ends and days to months to years are passed. The sole question left to be asked to oneself is that what beneficial tasks did I do that impacted not just mine but other's lives as well.</p>
