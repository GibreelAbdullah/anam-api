<h>Tarang 2015</h>
<p>A three-day fest at Lady Shri Ram College was worth attending with multi-colored events and a collage of rainbow like felicity. 16th, 17th and 18th January were the dates engraved in the heart’s history of unforgettable memories. The fun activities included skateboarding, cane and bamboo workshops, beg-borrow-steal, treasure hunt, nukkad natak, quizzes, creative writing, elocution competitions along with the melodious events, art, dance and singing, etc. Adding glamour to evening events arrived Zaeden, Nucleya, Raeth and Raghu Dixit, who painted the atmosphere with fun unbounded and limitless.</p>
<p>The beg-borrow-stealers were busy asking for biscuits, rings, mobile cover, etc. and the treasure hunters ran from one place to another in search of clues. The skateboarding workshop was an amazing thing for many, and even though each fall was painful it taught the importance of learning by falling. The contagious zeal and passion of the Nukkad-Natak performers was worth noticing. The rock-stars with musical instruments added to the atmosphere a sense of universality of music. Despite Delhi winters, the weather was superfine for the occasion and the sunshine was seen in the attire of the students gathered to celebrate.</p>
<p>Both the Hindi and English creative writing events were great and poetry recitations touched the heart. The diverse flavors were representative of rainbow-like varieties and richness of the mind of each participant. All the events showcased the talent of today’s youth and willingness to make the world a better, much better place.</p>
<p>The dreams of youth, when they support the truth,</p>
<p>Miracles happen and the world is changed.</p>
<p>The celebrations ended but with the fresh hopes of welcoming Tarang 2016. The end is inevitable, and so is hope.</p>
